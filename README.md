## 📚 Acknowledgment & Reference

This project is heavily inspired by and built upon the official implementation of **LViT: Language meets Vision Transformer in Medical Image Segmentation**.

🔗 [Original Repository by HUANGLIZI](https://github.com/HUANGLIZI/LViT)

📝 Citation:
Li, Zihan, et al. *"LViT: Language meets Vision Transformer in Medical Image Segmentation."* IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (2023).

That's a fantastic choice, Prajak! The [LViT (Language meets Vision Transformer)](https://github.com/HUANGLIZI/LViT) model provides a strong foundation for multimodal segmentation tasks—especially in medical imaging—and implementing it practically can help you:

- Understand how transformers process visual and textual features jointly,
- Gain hands-on experience in deploying SOTA models in health tech,
- Build real-world projects for research or professional application.

---

## ✅ Here's a structured plan for **practical implementation**:

---

### 🔧 **Step 1: Set Up the Environment**

Make sure you have:

- Python 3.7 (consider using a virtualenv)
- CUDA 11.2 (optional but recommended if you have GPU)
- Run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you get a NumPy error:
```bash
pip install bert-embedding
pip install numpy==1.17.5
```

---

### 📁 **Step 2: Prepare the Data**

You can start with the **MoNuSeg dataset**, since it's small and demo-ready.

#### 📥 Download:

- MoNuSeg dataset from the [official site](https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/Data/)

#### 📂 Arrange like this:
```
datasets/
└── MoNuSeg/
    ├── Train_Folder/
    │   ├── Train_text.xlsx
    │   ├── img/
    │   └── labelcol/
    ├── Val_Folder/
    └── Test_Folder/
```

---

### 🧠 **Step 3: Train the Model**

You can choose two paths:

#### 🔹 **Without Pretraining**
```bash
python train_model.py
```

#### 🔸 **With Pretraining (Recommended)**
First, train with a simpler model like U-Net. Then use that pretrained backbone for LViT:
```bash
# Modify `config.py` to set `model_name = 'LViT_pretrain'`
python train_model.py
```

---

### 🧪 **Step 4: Evaluate the Model**
After training, test and visualize:
```bash
python test_model.py
```

You’ll get:
- Dice & IoU metrics
- Visualized masks (saved in a folder like `./MoNuSeg/LViT/test-30epoch/visual/`)

If you face missing model file issues, I can help automate fallback or train-check logic.

## 💡 Practical Use Case Ideas

Now the real fun begins: applying this to real-world settings.

---

### 🩺 1. **Medical Image Diagnostics Aid System**

- 📊 Use LViT to segment and highlight regions in CT scans or histopathology images.
- 🧠 Integrate GPT (like BioGPT) to generate diagnostic descriptions from visual segments.
- 🌐 Build a Flask dashboard to upload images and view predictions.

---

### 🖼️ 2. **Interactive Annotation Tool**

- Use LViT to pre-annotate regions of interest.
- Use React or Streamlit to build a UI for doctors to:
  - Validate/change predictions
  - Add notes
  - Save datasets for further research

---

### 🧬 3. **Few-shot Learning with Small Medical Datasets**

- Apply LViT to adapt to new organs/diseases using transfer learning.
- Try training on 20–30 annotated slices and generalize using transformer language understanding.

---

### 🧪 4. **Cross-Modal Retrieval**

- Text prompt: "Lung region with nodules"
- Use LViT to filter and return CT scan segments that match this semantic query.

---

### 📊 5. **Research Paper Reproduction or Extension**

- Compare LViT with TransUNet or MedT on a new dataset (like ISIC skin lesion dataset).
- Tweak the `text_encoder` module or plug in other pretrained transformers (e.g., BioBERT).
